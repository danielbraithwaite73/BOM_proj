                        <p>The Book of Mormon takes place in “The Promised Land”. The promise of prosperity that the Lord had made with the Nephite people is often repeated throughout the verses. He tells His covenant people that if they keep the commandments, He will prosper them in the land. Today, we live in the Americas which was “The Promised Land” of The Book of Mormon. Because we live in the same land that the Nephites did, and because The Book of Mormon was written for our day, it is important that we pay attention to this promise that the prophets felt was important enough to repeat. </p>
                        <p>To put into perspective how frequently this promise is made, I listed a few times it is repeated, all within a few chapters of each other:</p>
                        <p>"My son, give ear to my words, for I say unto you, even as I said unto Helaman, that inasmuch as ye shall keep the commandments of God ye shall prosper in the land; and inasmuch as ye will not keep the commandments of God ye shall be cut off from his presence." (Alma 38:1)</p>
                        <p>"And this was their faith, that by so doing God would prosper them in the land, or in other words, if they were faithful in keeping the commandments of God that he would prosper them in the land; yea, warn them to flee, or to prepare for war, according to their danger;" (Alma 48:15)</p>
                        <p>"Blessed art thou and thy children; and they shall be blessed, inasmuch as they shall keep my commandments they shall prosper in the land. But remember, inasmuch as they will not keep my commandments they shall be cut off from the presence of the Lord." (Alma 50:20)</p>
